JMeter,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,A tool for automatically test and performance test.
single-spa,Trail,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,<p><strong><a href="https://single-spa.js.org/">single-spa</a></strong> is a JavaScript framework for bringing together multiple <a href="/radar/Techniques/micro-frontends">micro frontends</a> in a single front-end application. Although we advise against <a href="/radar/Techniques/micro-frontend-anarchy">micro frontend anarchy</a>, the use of micro frontends as an excuse to mix and match multiple frameworks, single-spa supports just that. We understand that there are legitimate scenarios such as upgrading to a new revision of a framework across multiple micro frontends where integration across multiple frameworks is necessary. single-spa has been a go-to framework for micro frontend integration for our teams, and they're finding it to work well with <a href="https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs">SystemJS</a> and managing different versions of a single dependency.</p>

Azure DevOps,Hold,Platforms,FALSE,<p><strong><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a></strong> services contain a set of managed services, including hosted Git repos, CI/CD pipelines, automated testing tooling, backlog management tooling and artifact repository. We've seen our teams getting more experience in using this platform with good results, which means Azure DevOps is maturing. We particularly like its flexibility; it allows you to use the services you want even if they're from different providers. For instance, you could use an external Git repository while still using the Azure DevOps pipeline services. Our teams are especially excited about <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/">Azure DevOps Pipelines</a>. Nevertheless, all the services offer a good developer experience that helps our teams deliver value.</p>
